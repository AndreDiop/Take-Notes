# About
This web application allows users to communicate messages with one another by posting and saving notes. The data entered is persistent and allows users to have written information available when the app is closed. Design inspiration was taken from the clandestine nature of CIA novels and spy drops.

This application uses an express backend and saves and retrieves data from a JSON file. 

On the front end, this application uses a Bootstrap framework and Font Awesome for the icons
